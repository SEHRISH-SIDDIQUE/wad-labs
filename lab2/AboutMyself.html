        <h1 class="">THINGS I LIKE IN WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p class="write">
            Web development is a interesting object . And the one who has interest in it enjoy it 
             while it doing .The thing i like about web development is that we are able to design different
             websites according to our need which seems interesting.Not only this designing the things according
             to yourself is also bit interesting. Using different tools and applying them together all of these things
             make web development a bit unique and allowing user to take depth information
             in it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="second">Links of the website i would like to develop in future are:</h3>
       <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/pk/">netflix</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.zara.com/">zara</a></li>

        <h1 class="">THINGS I DON'T LIKE IN WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p>              Despite being an interesting subjects there some thing i dont like in web development .
             The first thing is there is always toomuch to learn no matter how much you learn tags there are still some thing that
             you miss. If a person is paticularly using css it becomes quite difficult for him to set each and every
             thing in it. THen for only one thinhg there are too many tools which can also cause confuions for new
             learners

        <h1 class="">REPORT</h1>
        <h4>Included elements</h4>
        <p>section, divs ,nav, headings, paragraphs have been added as elements whereas for styling
            padding ,margin, some box styling elements like display ,justify content,align items ,are included moreover align text,
            family fonts are included
        </p>
        <h4>REASON</h4>
        <p>section was made to make sections,divs for seperate concerning boxex that were needed,nav for 
            navigation bar ,hn for headingd and p for paragraphs. Where as for styling padding for spavce within
            the box/element, margin for space outside the element ,dispaly flex for creating container in which 
            elements can be manipulated to our need like adjusting the image to center ,justify content for adjusting elements
            element for example sections first were alighned at center by first setting their main axis
            along colum by flex direction then all section were made at center by using justify content (for colum/main axis)
            and align items(row axis) ,then font family is used for font and align text is used to keep all text at
            center 
        </p>
       
        <h4>LEARNING</h4>
        <p>The things i learned are how to use css on html ,how to align different elements,what is the real
            use of divs ,aligning text ,uploading images etc
